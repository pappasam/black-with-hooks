# Formatters + Hooks: black, isort, pylint, and pre-commit

This repository provides a quick PoC to automate code linting before we are
able to commit Python code to git.

## Tools

* [black](https://github.com/ambv/black): a code formatter
* [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort): formats Python import statements
* [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint): a great linter
* [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit): a project that makes it easy to run the above tools pre-commit

## Setup

```bash
make setup
```

## Usage

1. Try to make the Python code in main.py poorly-formatted
2. Commit the poorly-formatted code
3. Squirm
